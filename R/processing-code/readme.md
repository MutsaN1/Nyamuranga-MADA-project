This folder contains code for processing data.

The code is stored in the processingfile-v1.qmd which then renders into the html document by the same name. 

The code produces a processeddata.rds file, which are saved in the appropriate `processed data` sub-folder.

There is also a small files folder that contains folders necessary for packages within the qmd file.
