This folder contains code to do some statistical analysis and modeling on the processed/cleaned data.
The code produces a few tables and figures, which are saved in the appropriate `results` sub-folder.

This includes figures and tables:

resulttable1.rds

resulttable2.rds

resulttable3.rds

The other files are Rdata and Rhistory files to make sure the code is running smoothly.
